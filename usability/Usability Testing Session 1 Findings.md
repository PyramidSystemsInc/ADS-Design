##Usability Test 1 Findings
1. The initial purpose of the site was clear and easily understood.
2. The search results were overwhelming, and need to be filtered better both automatically and manually.
3. Users wanted to refine their searches, return to previous steps, and generally navigate freely forward and backward within the search process in order to mitigate the effects of the large quantity of data.
4. Users gravitated towards the closest, easiest single-step process on each screen: clicking a table row or a close button. Portions of the application which were not on the standard website path (top left -> bottom left) were often omitted (in this case, the ingredients search).
5. The color scheme did not fit the users' mental model of a medical website, which primarily involved the colors white and blue.
6. Users wanted more information about the products they were researching: pricing, availability, and popularity. Finding a trusted and relevant manufacturer was a concern.
7. The list of missing products was difficult to grasp; a list of matching products could also provide useful information.

##Usability Test 1 Recommendations
1. Add "Edit Search" ability (return to search step from search results)
2. Add breadcrumb/button navigation back to search results from product details
3. Split into 2 search result tables:
>- Products without the ingredient
>- Products with the ingredient
4. Continue working on UI to accord with the Style Tile
5. Filter out specific manufacturers
6. Filter out homeopathic remedies, which are common search results for improvidently specified search terms
