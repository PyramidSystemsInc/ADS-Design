#Usability Testing Notes



##Session 1


######Tester 1

Pre-Task Info: No personal allergies, indicated product "could be useful for people"



Task 1: Headache, allergy to aspirin

- Wanted to type in symptoms, not purpose of drug

- Wanted to filter by price, which is her most important factor

- Wanted to see fewer results (100 is overwhelming)



Task 2: [Skipped due to lack of search-by-name in this version of the prototype]



######Tester 2

Pre-Task Info: Does not purchase OTC meds, but sometimes uses them


First Impressions: (unreadable)


Task 1:


- Types in "headache" into the "purpose" field
, reads the result of "headache"
- Clicks "View Results
" without entering an ingredient
>- "Makes me feel dizzy, there's just a lot of results"

>- Overwhelmed by the technical nature of the ingredients
- Scrolls down and across in the list, then clicks on a specific product (Headache by Natural Health Supply, which has almost no detailed info)

- Scans page, then returns to product search results

>- Wants to cross-reference common products with whether or not they have the allergen (this user did not filter the list)
>- Can't tell whether or not this list of active/inactive ingredients is comprehensive
>- Clicked on the shortest one with the simplest name, because "all the other ones have a lot of text that I'd rather not read. A lot of different types of punctuations or capitalizations are confusing, so the one in all caps, I'd rather choose that one."
>- "Also I've been too lazy to scroll down to read the other ones."
- Q. What would the most relevant result be for you?
> - The active ingredients, i.e. the allergens I should be concerned about.
- Q. If this list was only the things that didn't contain aspirin, and there was still a scroll bar, how would you figure out the relevant results for you?
> - "Something established. Looking at all these, it's hard to choose each one; I'd just choose the one that sounds the most legitimate and credible." (In this case, he chose Uriel Pharmacy, which is reputable compared to the other search results for purpose:headache.)

Post-Task Comments:

- The green search bar for medicine feels weird. Medicine is strongly associated with white.
>- Style tile is more in line with expected look and feel.
